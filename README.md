ure, here's a template for your README.md file:

cifs-mount.sh
This shell script is used to create a mount point for a Common Internet File System (CIFS) share. The script mounts a share name relative to the server and folder location on the CIFS server.

Requirements
You must have cifs-utils installed on your system to use this script. You can install this package on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install cifs-utils
Usage
Clone or download the cifs-mount.sh file to your system.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Modify the SERVER, SHARE_NAME, MOUNT_PATH, USERNAME, and PASSWORD variables in the script to match your CIFS server and mount point configurations.
Run the script by typing ./cifs-mount.sh.
The script will prompt you for your password. Enter the password associated with the USERNAME you specified in step 3.
Example
Suppose you have a CIFS server located at 192.168.0.10 and a share named myshare located in the folder /data. You want to mount this share to the /mnt/myshare directory on your local system. Here's how you would use the cifs-mount.sh script:

Open the cifs-mount.sh file in a text editor.

Modify the following variables in the script to match your CIFS server and mount point configurations:

bash
Copy code
SERVER="192.168.0.10"
SHARE_NAME="myshare"
MOUNT_PATH="/mnt/myshare"
USERNAME="myusername"
PASSWORD="mypassword"
Save the modified cifs-mount.sh file.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script by typing ./cifs-mount.sh.

Enter the password associated with the USERNAME you specified in step 2 when prompted.

The script will create a mount point at /mnt/myshare and mount the myshare share from the 192.168.0.10 server to that directory.
